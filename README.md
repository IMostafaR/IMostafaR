Oh, Hi👋. I'm always passionate about designing and building new stuff. I was doing chemistry research 👨‍🔬, so I was designing and synthesizing new materials, atom by atom, molecule by molecule for use in varied applications.</p>
<p align="center">
Also, I love computer and I always wanted to get my hands dirty with coding 👨‍💻. I tried several things, and since I enjoy building stuff, I found myself going towards web development to build fascinating and beautiful web applications, element by element, a block of code by a block of code, just like chemistry 😉. </p>
